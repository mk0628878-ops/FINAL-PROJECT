MULTI FEACTURE OF PASSENGER INDIAN FLIGHT TICKET PRICE PTEDICTION

Indian flight ticket price prediction uses multi-feature machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) to analyze factors like airline, route, departure time, booking date, and cabin class. Optimal booking, often 1-3 months in advance, and selecting midweek flights (Tue-Thu) are key to reducing costs. Key features include: 
1.Temporal Features: Days remaining before departure (crucial), date of journey, and departure/arrival time.
2.Contextual Features: Source and destination cities, number of stops, and airline company.
3.Service Features: Cabin class (economy, business). 

Key Factors Influencing Price:

1.Booking Timing: Prices typically drop for flights booked 1–3 months in advance.
2.Day of Week: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays often offer better value than weekends.
3.Seasonality & Demand: High demand and seasonal changes significantly impact pricing.
4.Operational Factors: High taxes and dollar-denominated costs in India contribute to higher fares
5.Model Application: Machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost are trained on historical data to identify these complex, non-linear relationships to predict future prices accurately.
