Indian flight ticket price prediction uses multi-feature machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) to analyze factors like airline, route, departure time, booking date, and cabin class. Optimal booking, often 1-3 months in advance, and selecting midweek flights (Tue-Thu) are key to reducing costs. Key features include: 
1.Temporal Features: Days remaining before departure (crucial), date of journey, and departure/arrival time.
2.Contextual Features: Source and destination cities, number of stops, and airline company.
3.Service Features: Cabin class (economy, business). 

Key Factors Influencing Price:

1.Booking Timing: Prices typically drop for flights booked 1–3 months in advance.
2.Day of Week: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays often offer better value than weekends.
3.Seasonality & Demand: High demand and seasonal changes significantly impact pricing.
4.Operational Factors: High taxes and dollar-denominated costs in India contribute to higher fares
5.Model Application: Machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost are trained on historical data to identify these complex, non-linear relationships to predict future prices accurately. 

Key Project Pillars and Trends:

1.Infrastructure Expansion: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is investing ~Rs 25,000 crores to upgrade regional hubs like Guwahati, Agartala, Imphal, and Dibrugarh.
2.Market Growth: India is projected to be the fastest-growing civil aviation market, with massive increases in passenger traffic.
3.Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO): Increased focus on MRO, with 5% uniform IGST on aircraft parts and policy incentives to boost local repairs.
4.Digital Transformation: Implementation of biometrics (DigiYatra) for seamless passenger flow and enhanced security.
5.Future Vision (Aviation 2047): A long-term vision to make India a global aviation hub, enhancing connectivity to tier-2 and tier-3 cities.

It states that moments after take-off, the plane's fuel control switches, which are normally used when starting the engines before a flight and shutting them down afterwards, had been moved from the "run" to the "cut-off" position. This would have deprived the engines of fuel, causing them to lose thrust rapidly

To analyze pricing, demand, and operational patterns for insights into passenger behavior, airline strategy, and market trends, often using machine learning for price prediction or identifying factors like airline, time, route, and stops affecting cost, to help businesses and travelers. Key goals include predicting ticket prices, understanding price variations across different factors, and optimizing flight schedules, notes.
